          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The doctype declaration lets the computer know what document is being used, in this case HTML</li>
          <li> lang= "en" lets the system know what language is being used for the website</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage- extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li> Examples of characteristic elements are as follows: "style", "base","link", "meta","script","viewpoint", etc.</style></li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>declarations contain two important sections:the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property. Ex: color: blue;</li>
          <li>Margin property- acts like margin in word document. not visible on the page. Ex: if we set the margin to 0; there is no padding around the element</li>
          <li>Padding property- adds space around the content inside of the element - increases size</li>
          <li>Margin and padding properties are part of the declaration block for the * selector. </li>
          <li>When combining two selectors into a style CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more laws of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li> Do Not Repeat Yourself or DRY code - coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>
          <li> img property assigns values to image element in the markup</li>
          <li> diplay property- assinged with the block value , which assigns each image to start a new line.</li>

          <li>There are two requirements for a JavaScript: Refining the function and calling the function. </li>
          <li>Truthy- whatever action in brackets is taken if condition isn't true, whatever is in the curly brackets will be ignored.</li>
          <li> Falsy- if condition is equal to one of the following values:0, -0, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>use of && operators in conditional statement. Ex: true && "dog" // returns "dog.</li>
          <li>Use of const to create variable. </li>
